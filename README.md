## Introduction
If we're keeping things a buck, I actually started experimenting with different ideas a couple months ago. I was studying for a course and I had a light bulb moment, "what if I implement my own chat-with-documents app"

I've used quite a few of these apps and they're amazing! I am able to generate questions based on a particular section/topic. It's pretty cool

I sat back at the drawing board--I remembered reading an article about Amazon Bedrock some months back and I thought hmm let's explore. I wanted to build my own application but the purpose of my exploration was to build fast. So I looked to see if it had been done before--and you bet it had! When using new tech or whatever the case may be, I like putting my own little spin on it


## Key Features

-  Amazon Bedrock integration for contextual knowledge retrieval
